# JeSemE
JeSemE (Jena Semantic Explorer) allows you to explore the semantic development of words over time based on distributional semantics. JeSemE is described in detail in our ACL 2017 paper ["Exploring Diachronic Lexical Semantics with JESEME"]( https://aclanthology.info/pdf/P/P17/P17-4006.pdf) and our COLING 2018 paper ["JeSemE: A Website for Exploring Diachronic Changes in Word Meaning and Emotion"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04148)

# Dependencies
Modified version of Omar Levy's [hyperwords](https://github.com/hellrich/hyperwords)

# Starting JeSemE
* Use maven to build an executable JAR (with dependencies) by executing mvn package in the folder "website" 
* Configuration is done via config.yaml, you must set correct paths for your system!
* Requires a Postgres Server, enter details in config
* Mapping between words and lemmata (German only, fit for historic texts) via normalized.csv (mappingPath in config)
* Files with trained models and derived emotions can be found online on JeSemE's [help page](https://jeseme.coling.uni-jena.de/)
* Use the JAR to execute the commands "initialize" first (creates necessary tables), then "import" (takes some hours & approx 30 GB), and finally start JeSemE via "server"
